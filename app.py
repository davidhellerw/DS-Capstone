    - **Market Cap (Market Capitalization)**: The total market value of a company‚Äôs outstanding shares. It is calculated by multiplying the current share price by the total number of outstanding shares. This metric indicates the company's size and overall value in the market.
    - **Previous Close**: The stock's last closing price from the most recent trading day. It provides a reference point for the stock's performance compared to its current trading price.
    - **52-Week High and Low**: The highest and lowest stock prices recorded over the past 52 weeks. These metrics show the stock's price range and help gauge its volatility.

    ### How to Read the Chart
    - **Closing Price (Blue Line)**: Represents the stock's closing price for each trading day.
    - **20-Day Moving Average (Orange Line)**: A short-term trend indicator.  
      - It calculates the average closing price over the past 20 trading days.  
      - A rising 20-day moving average often indicates a short-term uptrend.
    - **50-Day Moving Average (Green Line)**: A medium-term trend indicator.  
      - It calculates the average closing price over the past 50 trading days.  
      - It's generally used to identify longer-term trends compared to the 20-day moving average.
    
    #### Key Insights:
    1. **Crossovers**:  
       - When the 20-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average, it might indicate a bullish signal (buying opportunity).  
       - Conversely, when the 20-day crosses below the 50-day moving average, it might indicate a bearish signal (selling opportunity).
    2. **Trend Confirmation**:  
       - Both moving averages moving upwards can confirm an uptrend.  
       - Both moving downwards can indicate a downtrend.
    3. **Support/Resistance**:  
       - Moving averages can act as dynamic support or resistance levels for the stock price.

        **What these values mean:**
        
        - **Max Sharpe Ratio Portfolio Return:** This is the expected annualized return of the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe Ratio, based on historical data. For example, if the return is 20%, you can expect a USD 1,000 investment to grow to approximately USD 1,200 over one year under similar market conditions.
        
        - **Max Sharpe Ratio Portfolio Volatility:** This represents the expected annualized risk (volatility) of the portfolio, meaning the percentage by which returns might fluctuate. 
        
        - **Max Sharpe Ratio:** This measures the portfolio's risk-adjusted return. A Sharpe Ratio of 0.8, for example, means that for every unit of risk, the portfolio generates 0.8 units of excess return above the risk-free rate.

        **Risk-Free Rate Assumption:**
        - The risk-free rate is assumed to be **1%** (0.01) annually in this analysis. This reflects the approximate yield on short-term government bonds, which are considered low-risk investments. Adjusting the risk-free rate to reflect current market conditions may change the Sharpe Ratio but not the portfolio's allocation.

    ### What is LSTM and How Is It Used Here?
    
    **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) specifically designed to handle sequential data and long-term dependencies. It is particularly effective in time series forecasting, where the data points are connected over time.
    
    In this app:
    - The **LSTM model** is trained on past stock prices (adjusted close prices) to learn patterns and trends in the data.
    - Using the most recent **60 days of stock prices** as input, the model predicts the next day's price. This process is repeated iteratively to forecast multiple future days.
    
    ### How the Forecast Works:
    1. **Data Preparation**: The historical adjusted close prices are normalized (scaled to a range between 0 and 1) to help the model process the data effectively.
    2. **Sliding Window Input**: The model uses the last 60 days of prices to predict the next day‚Äôs price. This sliding window approach ensures the model has context for recent trends.
    3. **Iterative Prediction**: Once the next price is predicted, it is added back to the input data, and the process repeats for the specified number of days.
    
    ### Benefits of LSTM:
    - LSTMs can capture **non-linear relationships** and dependencies in the data, which makes them ideal for forecasting stock prices.
    - The iterative prediction process allows the model to forecast multiple steps into the future.
    
    **Note**: While LSTM models are powerful, stock prices are influenced by numerous external factors (e.g., market conditions, news, and macroeconomic trends) that the model may not account for, so predictions should be used cautiously.
